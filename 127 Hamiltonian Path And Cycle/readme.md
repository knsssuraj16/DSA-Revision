1. You are given a graph and a src vertex.
2. You are required to find and print all hamiltonian paths and cycles starting from src. The cycles must end with "*" and paths with a "."

Note -> A hamiltonian path is such which visits all vertices without visiting any twice. A hamiltonian path becomes a cycle if there is an edge between first and last vertex.
Note -> Print in lexicographically increasing order.
