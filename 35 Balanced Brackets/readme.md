1. You are given a string exp representing an expression.
2. You are required to check if the expression is balanced i.e. closing brackets and opening brackets match up well.

e.g.
[(a + b) + {(c + d) * (e / f)}] -> true
[(a + b) + {(c + d) * (e / f)]} -> false
[(a + b) + {(c + d) * (e / f)} -> false
([(a + b) + {(c + d) * (e / f)}] -> false
