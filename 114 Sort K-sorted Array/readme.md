1. You are given a number n, representing the size of array a.
2. You are given n numbers, representing elements of array a.
3. The array is nearly sorted. Every element is at-max displaced k spots left or right to it's position in the sorted array. Hence it is being called k-sorted array.
4. You are required to sort and print the sorted array.

Note -> You can use at-max k extra space and nlogk time complexity.
