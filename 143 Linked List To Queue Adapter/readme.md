1. You are required to complete the code of our LLToQueueAdapter class. 
2. As data members, you've a linkedlist available in the class.
3. Here is the list of functions that you are supposed to complete
     3.1. add -> Should accept new data in FIFO manner
     3.2. remove -> Should remove and return data in FIFO manner. If not available, 
     print "Queue underflow" and return -1.
     3.3. peek -> Should return data in FIFO manner. If not available, print "Queue 
     underflow" and return -1.
     3.4. size -> Should return the number of elements available in the queue
4. Input and Output is managed for you.

Note -> The intention is to use linked list functions to achieve the purpose of a queue. All the functions should work in constant time.
