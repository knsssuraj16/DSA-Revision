1. You are required to complete the code of our MinStack class. 
2. As data members you've one stack and a min element available in the class. (This is cryptic - take hint from video)
3. Here is the list of functions that you are supposed to complete
      3.1. push -> Should accept new data in LIFO manner.
      3.2. pop -> Should remove and return data in LIFO manner. If not available, print 
       "Stack underflow" and return -1.
      3.3. top -> Should return data in LIFO manner. If not available, print "Stack 
      underflow" and return -1.
     3.4. size -> Should return the number of elements available in the stack.
     3.5. min -> Should return the smallest element available in the stack. If not 
     available, print "Stack underflow" and return -1.
4. Input and Output is managed for you.

Note -> The judge maynot be able to check if all your functions are O(1) in time, but that is what the expectation is. Also, you can only use constant space.r
