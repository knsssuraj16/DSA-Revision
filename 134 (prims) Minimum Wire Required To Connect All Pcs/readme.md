1. You are given a graph and a source vertex. The vertices represent computers and the edges 
     represent length of LAN wire required to connect them.
2. You are required to find the minimum length of wire required to connect all PCs over a network. 
     Print the output in terms of which all PCs need to be connected, and the length of wire between 
     them.

Note -> For output, check the sample output and question video.
