1. You are given a graph, a source vertex and a destination vertex.
2. You are required to find and print all paths between source and destination. Print 
     them in lexicographical order.
    
    E.g. Check the following paths
             012546
             01256
             032546
             03256

    The lexicographically smaller path is printed first.
