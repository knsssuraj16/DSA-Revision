1. You are required to complete the code of our CustomQueue class. The class should mimic the behaviour of a Queue and implement FIFO semantic.
2. Here is the list of functions that you are supposed to complete
     2.1. add -> Should accept new data if there is space available in the underlying 
     array or print "Queue overflow" otherwise.
     2.2. remove -> Should remove and return value according to FIFO, if available or 
     print "Queue underflow" otherwise and return -1.
     2.3. peek -> Should return value according to FIFO, if available or print "Queue 
     underflow" otherwise and return -1.
     2.4. size -> Should return the number of elements available in the queue.
     2.5. display -> Should print the elements of queue in FIFO manner (space- 
     separated) ending with a line-break.
3. Input and Output is managed for you.
