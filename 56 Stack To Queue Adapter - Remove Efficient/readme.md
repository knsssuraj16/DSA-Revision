1. You are required to complete the code of our StackToQueueAdapter class. The class should mimic the behaviour of a Queue and implement FIFO semantic.
2. Here is the list of functions that are written in the class
    2.1. add -> Accepts new data if there is space available in the underlying array or 
    print "Queue overflow" otherwise.
    2.2. remove -> Removes and returns value according to FIFO, if available or print 
    "Queue underflow" otherwise and return -1.
    2.3. peek -> Returns value according to FIFO, if available or print "Queue 
    underflow" otherwise and return -1.
    2.4. size -> Returns the number of elements available in the queue.
3. Input and Output is managed for you.
