1. The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive numbers differ in only one bit.
2. Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the 
     sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.
 
 Example:
 Input: 2
 Output: [0,1,3,2]
 Explanation:
 00 - 0
 01 - 1
 11 - 3
 10 - 2
 [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.
 00 - 0
 10 - 2
 11 - 3
 01 - 1
