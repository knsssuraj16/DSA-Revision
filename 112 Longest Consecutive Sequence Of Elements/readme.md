1. You are given a number n, representing the size of array a.
2. You are given n numbers, representing elements of array a.
3. You are required to print the longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array (ignoring duplicates).

Note -> In case there are two sequences of equal length (and they are also the longest), then print the one for which the starting point of which occurs first in the array.
